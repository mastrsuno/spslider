This is a super simple, basic & lightweight responsive jQuery content slider to use
freely.

The slider can take pretty much any content be it images/text/iframe/video etc.

A basic demo can be seen here: http://somdow.com/spslider-demo/

and 

you can see a slightly modified version of it (with different medias on the slider) on my own website here: http://somdow.com/
